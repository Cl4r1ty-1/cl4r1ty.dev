Hello! My name is Ben but I go by Cl4r1ty everywhere online.

I am a tech enthusiast with a strong interest in cyber security.

I'm hoping to use this site to host CTF writeups and blog about stuff I find interesting.

Feel free to head over to the [Contact](/about/contact) page if you want to reach out.
